    Game process is the following:

    A Join Request should be sent to the game. This tells it
    to join a game (or start a new one if one isn't already waiting on a game).

    The Response stream will send through a BEGIN Response.State to let you know that
    the Game has been started.

    When the player recieves a START_TURN response, the server can take your input for the turn.

    When the player recieves a STOP_TURN response, the serer is no longer taking input for the turn.

    A WIN state says you won the game. A LOSE state means that you got an input wrong, and have lost.

    To send input, send a Request with an event type of Color.

    When you recieve a Response of type Color, then light up that colour.
